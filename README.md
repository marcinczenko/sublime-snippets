# sublime-snippets
A collection of Sublime Text snippets.

## How to install the snippets
You can copy the whole snippets directory to your Sublime Text `User` folder. To find the location of the `User` folder, from `Sublime Text` menu select `Preferences => Browse Packages`. This will reveal the `Packages` folder where your `User` folder should be located. If one does not exist, create it. 

You can also copy just a selection of snippets to any other folder of your preference. Just make sure it is inside of the `User` folder.

## Why all the `tabTrigger` names start with a dot?
This is to avoid conflicts with the [Emmet Sublime Text](http://emmet.io/blog/sublime-text-3/) package. You may change the tab triggers to your own liking :).
